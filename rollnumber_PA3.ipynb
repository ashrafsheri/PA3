    "            Humanity‚Äôs exodus to Earth Junior was a success‚Äîthanks to your incredible screening model. Over generations, humans have adapted to their new home, and peace has settled on Earth Junior. However, something strange has begun to occur among the advanced humanoid machines, called <code>Guardians</code>, who have served as protectors and caretakers for decades. Recently, a strange glitch has been detected in some Guardians. They exhibit erratic behaviors that resemble the old zombie behaviors from Earth. Scientists call this phenomenon <code>Code Rot</code> ‚Äî an anomaly in the neural networks controlling the Guardians, possibly due to lingering cosmic radiation or a mysterious extraterrestrial virus.\n",

    "        <p>\n",
    "            As humanity‚Äôs chief machine learning engineer, you're tasked with identifying Guardians at risk of Code Rot. Using a neural network model, you need to predict which Guardians might develop this infection-like behavior. A high <code>Code Rot probability</code> indicates the Guardian is likely to malfunction, while a low score suggests it's safe.\n",

    "            <strong><i>The mission is clear:</i></strong> Identify and quarantine any malfunctioning Guardians before they jeopardize the safety of Earth Junior's inhabitants. But beware‚Äîtime is limited, and the fate of humanity once again rests on your neural network‚Äôs ability to separate friend from foe.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this project, you are required to implement a binary classifier to predict whether a Guardian (humanoid machine) is infected with **Code Rot**‚Äîa malfunction that causes erratic behavior similar to a zombie-like state. The classifier should determine whether each Guardian is safe or infected based on CT scan images.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data:\n",
    "- You have been provided with **8580 CT scan images** of Guardians.\n",
    "- A **CSV file** contains labels indicating whether each image corresponds to a malfunctioning (infected) Guardian or not.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Your task is to develop a model that can accurately predict **whether there is infection or not** in these Guardians based on their CT scan images, and assess the performance of your classifier using appropriate metrics. You can choose between pytorch, keras or tensorflow to implement your model."
